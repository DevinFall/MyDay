## Simply task-tracking solution without the clutter of unnecessary features

### Built with C#, this application makes your day easier to plan out

Planning out your day is one of the most important things you can do to
prevent time from being wasted. Planning on paper isn't always the best,
because adjusting your schedule can be tedious and it's not easy to always
carry paper. Online planning applications are usually a mess of features that
only distract you and take away more of your time. However, MyDay only includes
the essential features needed to make a day more productive.

### Features

* Create small daily goals to help you stay on track
* Mark goals you've finished as done
* Delete goals you no longer need
* Edit existing goals
* Easy-to-understand user interface
* Simple configuration with docker-compose

### Installation
